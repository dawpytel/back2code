## Your Learning Journey Looks Like This

```
Module 1: System Design
├─ Design Phase (design artifacts)
├─ Implementation Phase (working API)
├─ Enhancement Phase (optimizations)
├─ Break & Observe (failure testing)
└─ Postmortem (deep reflection)
       ↓
    [Take break]
       ↓
Module 2: Data & Storage
├─ Design Phase
├─ Implementation Phase
├─ Enhancement Phase
├─ Break & Observe
└─ Postmortem
       ↓
    [Take break]
       ↓
Module 3: Reliability & Scalability
[... and so on ...]
```

**Each module follows the same pattern, making it easier as you progress!**

## Common Questions Before Starting

### "Do I need to know TypeScript/Node.js?"

No! The prompts guide you through learning as you build. Your Java background will transfer. Allocate extra time for language learning if completely new.

### "What if I get stuck?"

The prompts are designed to help you get unstuck:

- AI can explain concepts
- Phase prompts have troubleshooting sections
- You can ask AI specific questions
- Simplify and build MVP first

### "Can I modify the prompts?"

Absolutely! They're templates, not prescriptions. Adapt to:

- Your learning style
- Your available time
- Your interests
- Your background

### "Do I need to complete every enhancement?"

No. Focus on highest learning value. Document what you skip in backlog. Quality over quantity.

### "What if I want to skip a module?"

You can, but check dependencies:

- Modules 1-2 build foundation
- Later modules assume earlier knowledge
- Document in project.md if you skip

### "How do I know if I'm learning?"

Success indicators:

- Can explain concepts to others
- Can make design decisions with rationale
- Can implement without constant reference
- Can connect to real-world systems
